# You have [BLANK] Seconds to Escape

"You have [BLANK] Seconds to Escape" is a 3D puzzle game 
inspired by the 'Portal' Series that was created in the Unity Engine scripted in C#.

The game was created over the course of 3 days and features two different levels. The main premise of the game is to escape the room you've been placed by opening doors,
and parkouring onto platforms before the timer runs out.

The game allows you to pick up buttons and carry them around to place them onto buttons to open the matching colored door and allows you to move and jump around in a 3D space.

By placing cubes on their respective buttons (color coded), button's associated door will open. 

This game utilizes several of the Unity Engine's built in tools such as:
* Built-in Physics System
    * Rigid Bodies
    * Colliders
    * Character Controllers
* Baked Lighting System
* Scripting API
* Particle System  
* 3D Map Modeling System

**To download and play this game, download the folder titled "GameBuild" and run the "YouHave[BLANK]Seconds.exe" file.**
